# scripting-and-automation

Introduction
This guide will help you understand how to automate design flow in Xilinx Vivado using scripting. Youâ€™ll learn how to write scripts to perform synthesis, implementation. 

Why Scripting?
1. Automation: Automate repetitive tasks like synthesis, implementation, and bitstream generation.
2. EDA tools involve many repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as:
    Synthesis
    Place-and-route
    Timing analysis
    Simulation
    Generating reports
    With scripting, you can automate these tasks, reducing the need for manual intervention and freeing up time for engineers to focus on design optimization and debugging.
